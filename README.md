ðŸ“ˆ Coca-Cola Stock Prediction â€“ Live & Historical
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project predicts Coca-Cola's (KO) stock prices using historical market data and live stock feeds. The goal is to blend machine learning with time-series forecasting for real-world financial predictions.

The pipeline supports both offline training and live streaming predictions, making it suitable for dashboards, automated alerts, and investment analysis.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, YFinance

Algorithms: Random Forest Regressor

Data Sources: Yahoo Finance API (yfinance)

Other Tools: SQL, Excel for data storage and analysis

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Source: Yahoo Finance â€“ Ticker Symbol: KO

Date Range: Jan 2015 â€“ Dec 2024

Columns: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume

Additional engineered features:

MA_20 & MA_50: 20-day & 50-day moving averages

Daily_Return: Percentage change in closing price

Volatility: 20-day rolling standard deviation of daily returns

ðŸ“Š Features Implemented
Data Collection:
